Molecular Similarity Experiment

This experiment analyzes molecular similarity by encoding molecules into vector
representations and finding nearest neighbors based on representation distance.
The encoding method and distance metric are configurable via hooks, allowing
comparison of different molecular representation schemes (HDC, fingerprints, etc.).

Key Workflow:
    1. Load and filter molecular dataset from chem_mat_data
    2. Encode molecules into vector representations (via hook - HDC, fingerprints, etc.)
    3. Select random query molecules for similarity analysis
    4. For each query, find K nearest (most similar) neighbors using distance metric
    5. Optionally, find K most dissimilar molecules (furthest neighbors)
    6. Visualize query molecules alongside similar/dissimilar neighbors with scores

GED Correlation Analysis (Optional):
    When ENABLE_GED_ANALYSIS is set to True, the experiment additionally performs:
    1. Generate N-hop molecular neighborhoods using graph edit operations
    2. Track graph edit distance (GED) for each neighbor based on hop level
    3. Compute embedding similarity between query and all neighbors
    4. Calculate Pearson correlation and R² between GED and embedding similarity
    5. Create regression plots showing GED vs similarity relationship
    6. Aggregate statistics (average R², correlation) across all queries

The experiment is designed to be extended by sub-experiments that implement
specific encoding methods and distance metrics:
    - molecule_similarity__hdc.py: HDC encoding with cosine distance
    - molecule_similarity__fp.py: Fingerprint encoding with Tanimoto distance

Design Rationale:
    - Hook-based architecture enables comparison of different representation methods
    - Individual visualizations per query enable detailed inspection
    - Both similar and dissimilar molecules provide full spectrum of diversity
    - GED correlation analysis reveals relationship between structural and embedding distance
    - Configurable parameters allow adaptation to different use cases
    - Results stored in experiment storage for programmatic access

Usage:
    Create configuration files extending this experiment and specifying the
    molecular representation method:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        extend: molecule_similarity__hdc.py
